      <h3>The Bond History</h3>
      <div class="overview">
        <p>Bond Plywood was founded in 1979 by Mike and John Reynolds.  Mike was a CPA in private practice and John was an independent sales representative selling wood products to wholesale distributors, OEM's and retail lumber chains.</p>
        <p><img src="img/footer-tag.png" alt="" />They began by selling particleboard and hardwood plywood out of a small warehouse in Oxford, Michigan. Bond Plywood outgrew the Oxford location and moved into a larger facility in Fraser, Michigan three years later.  In 1986, they purchased a 40,000 square foot building in Ferndale, Michigan, where they still operate today.</p>
        <p>Bond Plywood is proud to represent some of the finest manufacturers in the woodworking industry. This list includes Panolam Surface Systems, Valspar, Meganite, Uniboard, States Industries, Brookside Veneers, Boise-Cascade, Georgia-Pacific, Rehau, JB Cutting, Valley Custom Door and Hettich.</p>
        <p class="highlight">The company's philosophy is simple:  Hire and train good people.  Sell quality products at competitive prices.  Provide great service.</p>
        <p>Bond Plywood is proud to be a family-owned business.  Mike and John, along with John's son, Bill Reynolds, daughter, Katie Luzier, and their dedicated employees remain committed to the company's philosophy that began over 30 years ago.</p>
